## Work experience

### April 2016 - now [Tabcorp](https://tabcorp.com.au)
**Role: technical team lead for Keno iOS app; technical team lead for Sunbets Casino Vegas, iOS and back-end development**

Helped hire and build the team, and bring the app to market. Worked with external testing agencies to get the app approved by the regulator, and internally with multiple stakeholders across business, product and design in an agile environment.

For Sunbets, helped set technical direction and provide a roadmap for shipping the product, working with product manager and
business analyst to develop estimates and break the project roadmap down into delivery phases.

### February 2015 - April 2016 [Galibugs.com](https://galibugs.com)
**Role: producing content, online marketing and teaching for Galibugs, online; consulting for mobile and web**

My wife Ivana and I started Galibugs in February 2015. We have worked on creating iOS app development courses and promoting them, as well as mobile and web consulting.

### March 2014 - December 2014: [Piethis.com](http://piethis.com)
**Role: Senior iOS developer, Back-end developer, Singapore**

Pie was building a better chat for work. Originally started as a platform for sharing links within a company in a visual way, through several iterations it came to be a more hipchat- or slack-like chat app for teams. Focusing on simplicity and elegant UI, Pie aimed to win users through great user experience.

Things at Pie were changing rapidly, and I built the whole iOS app from scratch two times: first when it was still about sharing links and then after the pivot to a chat app - with several design iterations in between.

The biggest challenge was the asynchronous nature of the app, which differed a lot from a typical REST client that most mobile apps are. Here messages are coming in all the time, they need to be sorted and processed in real-time while keeping in sync with the server, and making sure user experience is smooth and uninterrupted. The app was built for iOS7 and iOS8, and written partly in Swift.

In addition to the iOS app, I also worked on the back-end - both the REST API and other server-side services. The stack was NodeJS + PostgreSQL, all in CoffeeScript.

The company was later acquired by Google.

### May 2012 - March 2014: [Lumatic](http://lumatic.com) / acquired by [Nanigans](http://nanigans.com)
**Role: Senior iOS developer, Singapore; PHP developer, Singapore**

Lumatic was developing a navigation system for pedestrians, with proprietary routing algorithms at the core, and iOS navigation app Lumatic City Maps as the consumer-facing product. Acquired by Nanigans in October 2013 (the product was then shut down).

I was the sole iOS developer, and built the app from scratch, working closely with our product manager and graphics designer.

During the app development, we also experimented with background location tracking while conserving power, and region monitoring.

In addition to building the iOS app, I also worked on API development (Django), front-end on the developers' console (JavaScript/jQuery) and helped coordinating an out-sourced team in Indonesia building the Android version of the app.

In October, 2013, Nanigans acquired Lumatic. Nanigans is a company in ad-tech business, providing a SaaS product for optimizing your ad campaigns but automating bidding and a/b testing of ad units, predicting the lifetime value of the customer and maximizing ROI.

I worked on rebuilding a part of the product (ad analysis engine) to make it more scalable and fast (the system is dealing with billions of records which all need to be aggregated in different ways to
extract and show the useful data). I worked on modeling the database structure and providing an interface between the web front-end and data-processing back-end.

### March 2009 - April 2012: Bitmapa (my own development shop, now closed)
**Role: Acquiring clients, software development, working with other contractors.**

In March 2009 I started my own agency, and ran it until I moved to Singapore. During this time, I worked on various projects and took on longer term contracts with several companies:

#### May 2011 - March 2012: [ShoutEm](http://www.shoutem.com)
**Role: Lead iOS developer, Zagreb/Croatia**

ShoutEm is one of the leading mobile application builders in the world - they like to say they're building "Wordpress for mobile". I was working on the iPhone client as the lead iPhone developer.

At ShoutEm, I worked as the lead iOS developer working directly with the CTO, CEO and graphics designer. The main challenge was creating a very generic, modularized app that can be skinned and where certain parts can be turned on or off.

 _iOS, Xcode, Photoshop, Subversion, REST services_


#### September 2010 - April 2011: [Gamepires](http://www.gamepires.com)
**Role: Game programmer, Zagreb/Croatia**

Gamepires is a young but very passionate game development team/studio, and they've recently released their first game, GasGuzzlers.

I worked mainly on the toolset. The team started with a basic game engine, but no tools, and I built the world/level editor, material editor, some smaller utilities, and worked on game design (I wrote the original game design document, although it changed along the way).

 _C++, Visual Studio, Subversion, DirectX, game design, game development_


#### January 2010 - September 2010: [FiveMinutes Ltd.](http://www.fiveminutes.eu)
**Role: iOS developer, Zagreb/Croatia**

Five Minutes Ltd. is the "parent" company of ShoutEm, which was initially started there, but later branched into a separate entity. As my first longer-term freelance deal, I worked as iPhone developer for a couple of their clients: RealNetworks from Seattle and AppSmart from London.

This was the period when I developed my core iOS skills, and got additional experience working with remote teams, for different clients and on tight schedules.

 _iOS, Xcode, CVS, Objective-C, OpenGL, remote work_


#### Earlier roles

During university I worked at a couple of companies including AVL-AST (Python; tooling for developing internal combustion engines) and Soko Z.I. (C++/MFC; software for navigating drones).
