## Work experience

### March 2014 - now: [Piethis.com](http://piethis.com)
**Role: Senior iOS developer, Back-end developer, Singapore**

Pie is building a better chat for work. Originally started as a
platform for sharing links within a company in a visual way, through
several iterations it came to be a more hipchat- or slack-like chat
app for teams. Focusing on simplicity and elegant UI, Pie aims to win
users through great user experience.

Things at Pie have ben changing rapidly, and I built the whole iOS
app from scratch two times - first when it was still about sharing
links and then after the pivot to a chat app.

The biggest challenge was the asynchronous nature of the app, which
differs a lot from a typical REST client that most mobile apps
are. Here messages are coming in all the time, they need to be sorted
and processed in real-time while keeping in sync with the server, and
making sure user experience is smooth and uninterrupted. The app was
built for iOS7 and iOS8, and written partly in Swift.

In addition to the iOS app, I also worked on the back-end - both the
REST API and other server-side services. The stack was NodeJS +
PostgreSQL, all in Coffeescript.

### October 2013 - March 2014: (through acquisition of Lumatic) [Nanigans](http://nanigans.com)
**Role: PHP developer, Singapore**

Nanigans is a company in ad-tech business, providing a SaaS product
for optimizing your ad campaigns but automating bidding and a/b
testing of ad units, predicting the lifetime value of the customer and
maximizing ROI.

I have worked on rebuilding a part of the product (ad analysis engine)
to make it more scalable and fast (the system is dealing with billions
of records which all need to be aggregated in different ways to
extract and show the useful data). I worked on modeling the database
structure and providing an interface between the web front-end and
data-processing back-end.

 _PHP, MySQL_



### May 2012 - October 2013: [Lumatic](http://lumatic.com)
**Role: Senior iOS developer, Singapore**

Lumatic was developing a navigation system for pedestrians, with
proprietary routing algorithms at the core, and iOS navigation app
[Lumatic City Maps](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id501673331) as the
consumer-facing product. Acquired by Nanigans in October 2013.

I was the sole iOS developer, and built the app from scratch,
working closely with our product manager and graphics designer.

During the app development, we also experimented with background
location tracking while conserving power, and region monitoring.

In addition to building the iOS app, I also worked on API development
(Django), front-end on the developers' console (Javascript/jQuery) and
helped coordinating an out-sourced team building the Android version of
the app.

### May 2011 - March 2012: [ShoutEm](http://www.shoutem.com)
**Role: Lead iOS developer, Zagreb/Croatia**

ShoutEm is one of the leading mobile application builders in the
world - they like to say they're building "Wordpress for mobile". I
was working on the iPhone client as the lead iPhone developer.

Please see their website for more information, and here are some
iTunes links:

[Mobilizer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mobilizer-4/id632192457?mt=8), where you can test any apps you create on [ShoutEm](http://www.shoutem.com)

and a couple of applications built on the platform:

[PopCandy](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pop-candy/id451441871?mt=8)

[This is 50](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/thisis50/id540440346?mt=8)

Note: I have worked on the native version of the app. They have since
switched to HTML5, although the apps I've listed above are still
published using the native version (at the time of this writing).

At ShoutEm, I worked as the main iOS developer working directly with
the CTO, CEO and graphics designer. The main challenge was creating a
very generic, modularized app that can be skinned and where certain
parts can be turned on or off.

### September 2010 - April 2012: [Gamepires](http://www.gamepires.com)
**Role: Game programmer, Zagreb/Croatia**

Gamepires is a young but very passionate game development team/studio,
and they've recently released their first game, GasGuzzlers. 

I worked mainly on the toolset. They already had a basic game engine,
but no tools, and I built the world/level editor, material editor,
some smaller utilities, and worked on game design (I wrote the
original game design document, although it changed along the way).

 _C++, Visual Studio, Subversion, DirectX, game design, game development_



### January 2010 - September 2010: [FiveMinutes Ltd.](http://www.fiveminutes.eu)
**Role: iOS developer, Zagreb/Croatia**

Five Minutes Ltd. is the "parent" company of ShoutEm, which was
initially started there, but later branched into a separate entity. As
my first longer-term freelance deal, I worked as iPhone developer for
a couple of their clients: RealNetworks from Seattle and AppSmart from
London.

This was the period when I developed my core iOS skills, and got additional
experience working with remote teams, for different clients and on
tight schedules.

### March 2009 - January 2010: NightIrion
**Role: Founder, Zagreb/Croatia**

I started a sole proprietorship with the intent on doing freelance
work which would fund my own game development efforts.  During this
period, I worked for several, mostly US-based clients on smaller
iPhone projects. Most notable was cooperation with Marroni Electronic
entertainment on iLikeCereal!! and
[iBailout!!](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibailout/id333196767?mt=8). iLikeCereal!!
started as a contract project for GameLoft, but the deal fell through
and we eventually published it ourselves. Unfortunately it's not
available on the AppStore anymore, but it was a toy-app where you
could play with cereals in the milk, with realistic physics simulation
of the liquid and cereals floating inside. iBailout!! is a Pac-Man
type game with a few twists and a satirical theme about the bailouts
during the 2008 US recession. It was published by Hands-On Mobile.

### May 2008 - March 2009: [AVL-AST](https://www.avl.com/web/ast/home), [Croatian branch](https://www.avl.com/avl-ast-d.o.o)
**Role: Python/C++ developer, Zagreb/Croatia**

It's a position I will remember the most for having worked with some
of the most talented developers I have ever met. I was developing in
Python (which I have learned there) on a part of their core
development framework. This was a student job (3 days per week) where
I've gained invaluable knowledge from the smarter and more experienced
than myself.

_Python, C++, Linux, CVS, GTK+_



### June 2007 - May 2008: Soko Z.I.
**Role: C++/MFC developer, Zagreb/Croatia**

I worked on an unmanned aircraft control station. This was a student job
(3-4 days per week), marked by using bad technologies (MFC) and
working with great people. The project itself was interesting though
and I've learned a lot about deadlines, managing a big code base and
dealing with external devices. I even got a chance to briefly work on
the flight simulator used by the Croatian military. The company has
since closed.

_C++, MFC, Windows, UAV, simulator_


### Side projects

### Magic Match, [Nummu](http://nummu.com)

During my time at Lumatic, I developed a game called Magic
Match - A Wizard Competition. It's a free-to-play, blitz-style game
with unique mechanics.

I wanted to build something different, yet simple and accessible
enough as any of the match-3 games out there.

Although I've long ago stopped thinking of going back into the game
industry, I still sometimes get game ideas that itch to be tried
out. This was one of them, and although relatively early into
development I realized the mechanics aren't as attractive to other
people as I thought they would be, it was a hobby project I enjoyed so
I decided to finish it and make it the best it can be.

### Sleek

In my spare time during 2008, I developed and released my first iPhone
project,
[Sleek](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sleek/id293038915?mt=8). This
was the first Croatian iPhone app / game that was released in the
AppStore. At that time (2008), there were no frameworks available for
developing iPhone games, so a friend and I built our own, a simple 2D
game engine.

### Earlier jobs

Before Soko Z.I., I worked as a game developer for gambling machines
in a small company for a few months.

Prior to that, in 2006, I worked at CARNet (Croatian academic network)
in technical support call center, which was my first official job
(though not the first paid work I'd done). It wasn't programming, but
it was useful talking to people who weren't tech-oriented and
listening to their problems, trying to explain technical terms using
non-technical language and being patient with customers who want to
talk about their dogs :) It taught me a lot about customer service
which proved valuable later on.

During my first year of college, I developed my first commercial game,
called Bluerows. It was a logic / puzzle game and it was sold as
shareware on BigFishGames. I pulled it from the site several months
later, because it was picked up by a retail publisher in Croatia. It
can still be found on the shelves of some Croatian supermarkets.

In high-school, I worked as a game developer for a really cool small
company which was producing custom gambling machines, and I worked on
several RentACoder projects.




## Skills and technologies

I strongly believe a good programmer should never confine him/herself
to a particular platform, technology, API, etc. Technology is a tool
and I'm confident I can adapt to whatever it is that will get the job
done. However, like most programmers I do this work because I enjoy
it, and there are technologies I really wasn't able to make peace with
(like Java and .Net for example). Also, most companies need people who
can immediately start contributing to a project and can't afford
having them learn something from scratch, so here is a list of
programming languages and technologies that I have worked and
consider to have meaningful experience with, in no particular order.

### Programming languages

* Objective-C - excellent. I can't say I know everything there is to
  know about the language, but I've been using it for 5 years now, and
  I'm aware of most of the details and nuances. It's probably the
  language I'm most productive in.
* Python - intermediate. I used it for 8 months at AVL-AST, at which
  point I knew it quite well (had some amazing mentors). However, that
  was really a long time ago and I have certainly got a little bit
  rusty. I refreshed my knowledge a bit at Lumatic but I can't say I'm
  an expert.
* Javascript - intermediate. I don't have much professional experience
  with it, but I've used it a fair amount in my personal projects and
  I really love the language.
* Swift - it's a young language and tools are quite flaky at the
  moment, but I've used it at Pie and would have no problems
  developing a project using it.
* Coffeescript - intermediate. I've used it for back-end development
  at Pie. 
* C++ - intermediate. Before I started developing for the iPhone, this
  was my language of choice, and I had used it for years. Afterwards,
  on iOS and in web development, there wasn't much need for it so I
  haven't used it in a while. I think I'd be up to speed relatively
  quickly if I needed to.
* SQL - intermediate. Also something I don't have the need for every
  day, but I usually have no problems getting things done.


### Libraries, SDKs and APIs

* iOS SDK. iOS SDK is what I have been working with for the last 6
  years almost without a break. It's big, so there are still some
  areas I haven't touched, but overall, I'm very comfortable with it
  and love using it.
* Node.js. Node was an amazing discovery for me. Lean, clean and
  beautiful. I'm not an expert, but can find my way around and would
  be happy to learn more.
* Cocos2D. I've used it for iBailout!!, several contract projects and
  in my latest game, Bamboozle Blast. I think it's very well designed,
  packs a lot of features and is really the best option if you want to
  build a 2D game today, short of building your own technology.
* MySQL and PostgreSQL. I have more experience with MySQL, but have
  used both.
* Django. I've gained some experience working with Django at Lumatic,
  but I'm not familiar enough with it to take on a whole project based
  on it.
* MongoDB. Still a beginner, but I like it. I don't think it's the
  answer to everything, but I think it can successfully complement a
  relational database in many situations and result in less resources
  required and faster development time.
* OpenGL/ES. I used it in Sleek, iLikeCereal and several contract
  projects. I really loved OpenGL, but at some point I just moved on
  to higher-level libraries and frameworks, and didn't have the need
  to use it much (especially with 2D games).
* OpenCL. My master thesis was about generating procedural textures
  using OpenCL and it was fun. It's quite easy to learn, but of course
  there are many intricacies related to optimization and structuring
  your code for optimal performance.


### Tools

* Xcode. After using it for 5 years, and through 3 major redesigns,
  it's the tool I use the most and am really comfortable with.
* Git. After using Git for a while, I just wonder how I was ever able
  to live without it. Very hard to explain why, though.
* Photoshop. I'm pretty skilled with Photoshop - I'm not a great
  designer in any sense, but whatever technical task needs to be done
  in Photoshop, I'm pretty sure I can do it, and quickly.
* Subversion. I'm not even sure I want to list this here, but I had
  used it for a few years. Nowhere near as good as Git, though.
* Visual Studio. 

### Other

* solid understanding of data structures and algorithms
* interfacing with web services, as well as implementing them
* basic design skills
* Agile/SCRUM experience
* linux/unix
* experience writing technical / product documentation
* project planning and estimating time/cost
* presentations/talks


### Programming competitions

I started competing in the 7th grade, when I won the 16th position in
the state-level competition. Next year, in the 8th grade, I won the
4th place.

In high-school, I won the 6th place in my 2nd year and 5th place in my
3rd year.


## Current interests

I want to build great things and work with great people. I love
startups because there is much less need to preserve the old ways and
keep everything the same; because there's a desire to do something big
and different; because everything moves much faster; because there
aren't unnecessary hierarchy levels killing good ideas. So that's what
I'm looking for - an opportunity to do great work with great people,
to change things and build amazing products.

Aside from programming, I'm very interested in many other aspects of
business, from marketing and product development to customer support
and design. That's why I try to keep close to startups, where I have a
chance to learn and work on many different things in the company.

In my spare time, I cook a lot, play tennis, dive, brew beer, make cheese, travel,
meet new people, and just try to enjoy my life.

I love simplicity and elegance, happy customers, great products and
nature, especially water in all forms - ocean, sea, rivers, lakes,
snow, rain...

I hate mediocrity, all things ugly and cold weather :)


## Education

I hold a master's degree in Computing (a silly name for computer
science in Croatia), from the University of Zagreb, Croatia.
