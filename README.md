# Ivan Galic

Hello, thanks for visiting my CV page. I've tried listing the most important general information here, but feel free to contact me if you have any questions. 


## Work experience

### May 2012 - now: [Lumatic](http://lumatic.com)
Role: Senior iOS developer, Singapore

Lumatic develops a navigation system for pedestrians, with proprietary routing algorithms at the core, and iOS navigation app [Lumatic City Maps](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id501673331) as the consumer-facing product. I am the sole iOS developer, and have built the app from scratch, working closely with our product manager and graphics designer. 
In addition to building the iOS app, I have also worked on API development (Django), front-end on the developers' console (Javascript/jQuery) and helped coordinating an outsourced team building the Android version of the app.



### May 2011 - March 2012: [ShoutEm](http://www.shoutem.com)
Role: Lead iOS developer, Zagreb/Croatia

ShoutEm is one of the leading mobile application builders in the world. I've been working on the iPhone part of the platform as the lead iPhone developer.

Please see their website for more information, and here are some iTunes links:

[Mobilizer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mobilizer/id413504031?mt=8), where you can test any apps you create on [ShoutEm](http://www.shoutem.com)

and several applications built on the platform:

[PopCandy](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pop-candy/id451441871?mt=8)

[The Yankee Analysts](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-yankee-analyst/id448297317?mt=8)

[This is 50](https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/thisis50/id540440346?mt=8)

Note: I have worked on the native version of the app. They have since switched to HTML5, although the apps I've listed above are still published using the native version (at the time of this writing).

At ShoutEm, I've worked as the main iOS developer working directly with the CTO, CEO and graphics designer.


### September 2010 - April 2012: [Gamepires](http://www.gamepires.com)
Role: Game programmer, Zagreb/Croatia

Gamepires is a young but very passionate game development team/studio, and they've recently released their first game, GasGuzzlers. 

I have worked mainly on the toolset. They already had a basic game engine, but no tools, and I built the world/level editor, material editor and some smaller utilities, as well as worked on game design (I wrote the original game design document, although it changed along the way).


### January 2010 - September 2010: [FiveMinutes Ltd.](http://www.fiveminutes.eu)
Role: iOS developer, Zagreb/Croatia

Five Minutes Ltd. is the "parent" company of ShoutEm, which was initially started there, but later branched into a separate entity. My first longer-term freelance deal, I've worked as iPhone developer for a couple of their clients: RealNetworks from Seattle and AppSmart from London.

This was the period when I honed my iOS skills the most, and got additional experience working with remote teams, for different clients and on tight schedules.


### March 2009 - January 2010: NightIrion
Role: Founder/freelancer, Zagreb/Croatia

I started a sole proprietorship (because starting an LLC in Croatia is both very expensive - especially for a college student - and extremely bureaucratic), with the intent on doing freelance work which would fund my own game development efforts. 
During this period, I worked for several, mostly US-based clients on smaller iPhone projects. Most notable was cooperation with Marroni Electronic entertainment on iLikeCereal!! and [iBailout!!](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibailout/id333196767?mt=8). iLikeCereal!! started as a contract project for GameLoft, but the deal fell through and we eventually published it ourselves. Unfortunately it's not available on the AppStore anymore, but in short it was a toy-app where you could play with cereals in the milk, with realistic physics simulation of the liquid and cereals floating inside. iBailout!! is a Pac-Man type game with a few twists and a satirical theme about the bailouts during the 2008 US recession. It was published by Hands-On Mobile. 


### May 2008 - March 2009: [AVL-AST](https://www.avl.com/web/ast/home), [Croatian branch](https://www.avl.com/avl-ast-d.o.o)
Role: Python/C++ developer, Zagreb/Croatia

It's a position I will remember the most for having worked with some of the most talented developers I have ever met. I've been developing in Python (which I have learned there) on a part of their core development framework. This was a student job (3 days per week) where I've gained invaluable knowledge from the smarter and more experienced than myself. 

In my spare time during this period, I had also developed and released my first iPhone project, [Sleek](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sleek/id293038915?mt=8). This was the first Croatian iPhone app / game that was released in the AppStore. At that time (2008), there were no frameworks available for developing iPhone games, so a friend and I built our own, simple 2D game engine. 



### June 2007 - May 2008: Soko Z.I.
Role: C++/MFC developer, Zagreb/Croatia

I worked on an unmanned aircraft control station. Also a student job (3-4 days per week), marked by using bad technologies (MFC) and working with great people. The project itself was interesting though and I've learned a lot about deadlines, managing a big code base and dealing with external devices. I even got a chance to briefly work on the flight simulator used by the Croatian military. The company has since closed.


### Earlier jobs

Before Soko Z.I., I had worked as a game developer in a small company on gambling machines for a few months, but they disliked paying the developers for their work so I left quickly. 

Prior to that, in 2006, I worked at CARNet (Croatian academic network) in technical support call center. That was my first official job. It wasn't programming, but it was useful talking to people who weren't tech-oriented and listening to their problems, trying to explain technical terms using non-technical language and being patient with customers who want to talk about their dogs :)

During my first year of college, I developed my first commercial game, called Bluerows. It was a logic / puzzle game and it was sold as shareware on BigFishGames. I had pulled it from the site several months later, because it was picked up by a retail publisher here in Croatia. It can still be found on the shelves of some Croatian supermarkets.

In high-school, I worked as a game developer for a really cool small company which was producing custom gambling machines, and I worked on several RentACoder projects.


## Skills and technologies

I strongly believe a good programmer should never confine him/herself to a particular platform, technology, API, etc. Technology is just a tool and I'm confident I can adapt to whatever it is that will get the job done. However, like most programmers I do this work because I enjoy it, and there are technologies I really wasn't able to make peace with (like Java and .Net for example). Also, most companies need people who can immediately start contributing to a project and can't afford having them learn something from scratch, so here is a list of programming languages and technologies that I have worked with and consider meaningful, in no particular order.

### Programming languages

* Objective-C - excellent. I can't say I know everything there is to know about the language, but I've been using it for 5 years now, and I'm aware of most of the details and nuances. I'm quite fast when developing using it, too.
* Python - intermediate. I used it for 8 months at AVL-AST, at which point I knew it quite well (had some amazing mentors). However, that was really a long time ago and I have certainly got a little bit rusty. I refreshed my knowledge a bit at Lumatic but I can't say I'm an expert.
* Javascript - intermediate. I don't have much professional experience with it, but I've used it a fair amount in my personal projects and I really love the language. I think it's the language with the most undeservedly bad reputation.
* C++ - intermediate. Before I started developing for the iPhone, this was my language of choice, and I had used it for years. Afterwards, on iOS and in web development, there wasn't much need for it so I haven't used it in a while. I think I'd be up to speed relatively quickly if I needed to.
* SQL - intermediate. Also something I don't have the need for every day, but I usually have no problems getting things done.


### Libraries, SDKs and APIs

* iOS SDK. iOS SDK is what I have been working with for the last 5 years almost without a break. It's big, so there are still some areas I haven't touched, but overall, I'm very comfortable with it and love using it.
* Cocos2D. I've used it for iBailout!!, several contract projects and in my latest game, Bamboozle Blast. I think it's very well designed, packs a lot of features and is really the best option if you want to build a 2D game today, short of building your own technology.
* Django. I've gained some experience working with Django at Lumatic, but I'm not familiar enough with it to take on a whole project based on it.
* Node.js. Node was an amazing discovery for me. Lean, clean and beautiful. So far, I've only built the back-end for Bamboozle Blast in Node, but I'm ready to take on any challenge :) 
* MongoDB. Still a beginner, but I like it. I don't think it's the answer to everything, but I think it can successfully complement a relational database in many situations and result in less resources required and faster development time.
* OpenGL/ES. I used it in Sleek, iLikeCereal and several contract projects. I really loved OpenGL, but at some point I just moved on to higher-level libraries and frameworks, and didn't have the need to use it much. 
* OpenCL. My master thesis was about generating procedural textures using OpenCL and it was fun. It's quite easy to learn, but of course there are many intricacies related to optimization and structuring your code for optimal performance.

### Tools

* Xcode. After using it for 5 years, and through 3 major redesigns, it's the tool I use the most and am really comfortable with. 
* Git. After using Git for a while, I just wonder how I was ever able to live without it. Very hard to explain why, though.
* Photoshop. I'm pretty skilled with Photoshop - I'm not a great designer in any sense, but whatever technical task needs to be done in Photoshop, I'm pretty sure I can do it, and quickly.
* Subversion. I'm not even sure I want to list this here, but I had used it for a few years. Nowhere near as good as Git, though.
* Visual Studio. Probably still the best development environment for C++. I don't use C++ much anymore though, so I don't miss VS either. If I had to do C++ development though, I would be tempted to switch from Xcode to Visual Studio.

### Other

* Agile/SCRUM experience
* experience writing technical / product documentation
* project planning and estimating time/cost
* interfacing with web services, as well as implementing them
* solid understanding of data structures and algorithms
* linux/unix 
* presentations/talks
* basic design skills


### Programming competitions

I started competing in the 7th grade, when I won the 16th position in the state-level competition. Next year, in the 8th grade, I won the 4th place.

In high-school, I won the 6th place in my 2nd year and 5th place in my 3rd year.


## Current interests

I want to build great things. I love startups because there is much less need to preserve the old ways and keep everything the same; because there's a desire to do something big and different; because everything moves much faster. So that's what I'm looking for - an opportunity to do great work, to change things and build great products. 

Aside from programming, I'm very interested in many other aspects of business, from marketing and product development to customer support and design. That's why I try to keep close to startups, where I have a chance to learn and work on many different things in the company.

In my spare time, I cook a lot and I'm trying to get to know South-East Asia the best I can. 

I love simplicity and elegance, happy customers, great products and water - ocean, sea, rivers, lakes, rain... I hate mediocrity, all things ugly and cold weather :)

## Education

I hold a master's degree in Computer Science, from the University of Zagreb, Croatia.


## Why you should hire me

At the end of any resume, this question is what it comes down to. Not everyone is a good fit for every company and while neither of us will know until we learn more about each other, here are some of the reasons why you may or may not want to hire me. 

You may want to hire me because:

* You need someone good, ambitious and responsible. I'm no ninja and I certainly don't feel like a rock star, but I think I'm pretty good, and getting better. I'll stop now and let my past references and future work speak instead :)
* You need a strong individual who can work as a team player. I can work independently, but when needed I'm always ready and happy to help a team member or do whatever is in the best interest of the team and company.
* You want someone who'll do what needs to be done instead of saying "it's not my job". I can't (and don't want to) do everyone's job, but I'll jump in when I can, and always try to propose solutions instead of just complaining about the problems. 
* You want someone who can communicate like a human being. This should go without saying, but is worth mentioning in our industry, I think.
I'm always ready to learn and improve, I'm competitive and constantly striving to keep on top, which means your team has a better chance of keeping on top, too.
* If I commit to a project or company, I'm fully dedicated and do my best to help. I never work just waiting for the month to go by, and I never take a job just do to something.

You might not want to hire me because:

* You want a code monkey. I seek interesting problems and challenges; there are people who'll be happy to just sit and type all day thinking about how they'll drink a beer afterwards, waiting for their paycheck. It's just not me (not that I don't like me a beer afterwards). Every job has more and less interesting parts, there's no avoiding that. But if you need someone to produce meaningless code, we're not a good match.
* You want someone who just codes 24/7. That's not me, I'm sorry. I work hard, but constantly working overtime is of no use to either of us. I get unhappy, de-motivated, hate my work, lose concentration and do a bad job. You get poor quality, a bunch of problems in the present and in the future, unhappy team and you lose developers. A real need to finish something by a particular date for everyone's benefit can happen from time to time. That's ok, as long as it's not a routine. And requiring people to leave their souls in the office just because it's a "startup" is no excuse either.
